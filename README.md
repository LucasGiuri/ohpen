I really enjoy the test ! thanks for the opportunity !
i used 6 hours to develop the project and there are a couple a things that i can improve in some more hours, im not the fastest dev in the planet but i tried to use the time  estimated doing my best.

### Improvements

1 - the testing for the actions, all the tests that i have (26 i think) are snapshot testing for now, so the acitons itself i could not have time to test htem
2 - the design itself, i do not have the correct css properties so i tried to replicate the components but without any rule
3 - I could not indicate which is the current page and mark it as bold, is something that i can do in just minutes but i would like to make a small refactor first maybe
4 - Use a normal endpoint instead of having the fake data in a const in constants.js
